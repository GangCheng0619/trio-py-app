Trio â€“ async I/O for humans
===========================

write apps that sing in three-part harmony

emphasis on usability: goal is to help you write programs that are
safe, correct, low latency, high throughput
(in that order)

is it fast? it's not slow; for real optimization though going to wait
until we have real programs, b/c we'd rather not get into a fight over
who has the fastest echo server in the west. (rule: optimizations must
either demonstrate appreciable speedups on realistic (ideally real)
applications *or* demonstrate appreciable speedups on
microbenchmarks + be ~neutral WRT to code maintainability.)

minimal (TOOWTDI), layered design
-> as a way to minimize the tension between stability and experimentation
(e.g., there is only one *built-in* synchronization primitive, the
ParkingLot; we provide the standard set of primitives like locks,
queues, etc. built on top of it, but you can pretty easily write your
own if you need them.)

make it as easy as possible to reason about concurrency and
cancellation
documented which points are cancellation points, etc.
clear principles for which functions are async and which aren't

exceptions cannot pass silently

goals that we don't meet yet, but want to:
rigorous test suite
cross-platform (and only *one* implementation per platform)
stable



design/API principles:

functions that take thunks (run, spawn, call_soon_threadsafe,
run_in_thread, ...) all follow the pattern

def caller(thunk, *args_for_thunk, *, **kwargs_for_caller)


"notify"-style operations are sync-colored

potentially-blocking operations always check for cancellation first,
and always invoke the scheduler


spawn is special: it's the only async-colored primitive that executes
synchronously. (it's unconditionally synchronous.)
all other async-colored primitives are unconditionally cancellation
points and unconditionally invoke the scheduler.
for non-primitives,
=> async means: at least sometimes invokes concurrency, suspension,
cancellation
admittedly this is a conceptual distinction rather than a strict
technical one, e.g. we could set up a "spawn server" and then send
spawn requests to it using synchronous calls to put_nowait, but we
conjecture that it's a useful conceptual distinction.
and in fact threads can do this!


next:
- rename Interrupt to Cancel
- does it work?
- IOCP
- implement signal handling on top of new call_soon
- implement {run,await}_in_main_thread on top of new call_soon
- document the low-level API
