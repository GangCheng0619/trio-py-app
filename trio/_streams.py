    together two unidirectional streams to make single bidirectional stream.

      receive_stream (~trio.abc.ReceiveStream): The stream to use for
          receiving.

    Example:

       A silly and deadlock-prone way to make a stream that echoes back
       whatever you write to it::

          sock1, sock2 = trio.socket.socketpair()
          echo_stream = StapledStream(sock1, sock2)

    .. attribute:: recv_stream

       The underlying :class:`~trio.abc.RecvStream`. :meth:`recv` is delegated
       to this object.
