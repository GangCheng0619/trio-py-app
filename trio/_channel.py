# rename SendChannel/ReceiveChannel to SendHandle/ReceiveHandle?
# eh, maybe not -- SendStream/ReceiveStream don't work like that.

# send or send_object? eh just send is good enough

# implementing this interface on top of a stream is very natural... just
# pickle/unpickle (+ some framing). Actually, even clone() is not bad at
# all... you just need a shared counter of open handles, and then close the
# underlying stream when all SendChannels are closed.

# to think about later:
# - max_buffer_size=0 default?
# - should we make ReceiveChannel.close() raise BrokenChannelError if data gets
#   lost? This isn't how ReceiveStream works. And it might not be doable for a
#   channel that reaches between processes (e.g. data could be in flight but
#   we don't know it yet). (Well, we could make it raise if it hasn't gotten a
#   clean goodbye message.) OTOH, ReceiveStream has the assumption that you're
#   going to spend significant effort on engineering some protocol on top of
#   it, while Channel is supposed to be useful out-of-the-box.
#   Practically speaking, if a consumer crashes and then its __aexit__
#   replaces the actual exception with BrokenChannelError, that's kind of
#   annoying.
#   But lost messages are bad too... maybe the *sender* aclose() should raise
#   if it lost a message? I guess that has the same issue...
# - should we have a ChannelPair object, instead of returning a tuple?
#   upside: no need to worry about order
#   could have shorthand send/receive methods
#   downside: pretty annoying to type out channel_pair.send_channel like...
#   ever. can't deconstruct on assignment. (Or, well you could by making it
#   implement __iter__, but then that's yet another quirky way to do it.)
# - is their a better/more evocative name for "clone"? People seem to be
#   having trouble with it, but I'm not sure whether it's just because of
#   missing docs.
# - and btw, any better names than Channel (in particular vs. Stream?)
# - should the *_nowait methods be in the ABC? (e.g. doesn't really make sense
#   for something like websockets...)
# - trio.testing.check_channel?


def open_memory_channel(max_buffer_size):
    """Open a channel for passing objects between tasks within a process.

    This channel is lightweight and entirely in-memory; it doesn't involve any
    operating-system resources.

    The channel objects are only closed if you explicitly call
    :meth:`~trio.abc.AsyncResource.aclose` or use ``async with``. In
    particular, they are *not* automatically closed when garbage collected.
    Closing in-memory channel objects is not mandatory, but it's generally a
    good idea, because it helps avoid situations where tasks get stuck
    waiting on a channel when there's no-one on the other side.

    Args:
      max_buffer_size (int or math.inf): The maximum number of items that can
        be buffered in the channel before :meth:`~trio.abc.SendChannel.send`
        blocks. Choosing a sensible value here is important to ensure that
        backpressure is communicated promptly and avoid unnecessary latency;
        see :ref:`channel-buffering` for more details. If in doubt, use 0.

    Returns:
      A pair ``(send_channel, receive_channel)``. If you have
      trouble remembering which order these go in, remember: data
      flows from left â†’ right.
