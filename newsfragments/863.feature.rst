:class:`trio.Process` on POSIX systems no longer accepts the error-prone
combination of ``shell=False`` with a ``command`` that's a single string,
or ``shell=True`` with a ``command`` that's a sequence of strings.
These forms are accepted by the underlying :mod:`subprocess.Popen`
constructor but don't do what most users expect. Also, added an explanation
of :ref:`quoting <subprocess-quoting>` to the documentation.
