``trio.signal_catcher`` has been deprecated in favor of
:func:`open_signal_receiver`. The main differences are:

- it takes \*-args now to specify the list of signals (so
  ``open_signal_receiver(SIGINT)`` instead of
  ``signal_catcher({SIGINT})``)
- the async iterator now yields individual signals, instead of
  "batches"
