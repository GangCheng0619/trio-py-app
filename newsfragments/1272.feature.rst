If you're using Trio's low-level interfaces like
`trio.hazmat.wait_readable` or similar, and then you close a socket or
file descriptor, you're supposed to call `trio.hazmat.notify_closing`
first so Trio can clean up properly. But what if you forget? In the
past, Trio would tend to either deadlock or explode spectacularly.
Now, it's much more robust to this situation, and should generally
survive. (But note that "survive" is not the same as "give you the
results you were expecting", so you should still call
`~trio.hazmat.notify_closing` when appropriate. This is about harm
reduction and making it easier to debug this kind of mistake, not
something you should rely on.)

If you're using higher-level interfaces outside of the `trio.hazmat`
module, then you don't need to worry about any of this; those
intefaces already take care of calling `~trio.hazmat.notify_closing`
for you.
