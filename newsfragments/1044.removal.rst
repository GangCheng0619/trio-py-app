Most of the public classes that Trio exports – like `trio.Lock`,
`trio.SocketStream`, and so on – weren't designed with subclassing in
mind. And we've noticed that some users were trying to subclass them
anyway, and ending up with fragile code that we're likely to
accidentally break in the future, or else be stuck unable to make
changes for fear of breaking subclasses.

There are also some classes that were explicitly designed to be
subclassed, like the ones in ``trio.abc``. Subclassing these is still
supported. However, for all other classes, attempts to subclass will
now raise a deprecation warning, and in the future will raise an
error.

If this causes problems for you, feel free to drop by our `chat room
<https://gitter.im/python-trio/general>`__ or file a bug, to discuss
alternatives or make a case for why some particular class should be
designed to support subclassing.
