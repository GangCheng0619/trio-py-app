A bug related to the following methods has been introduced in version 0.12.0:

- `trio.Path.iterdir`
- `trio.Path.glob`
- `trio.Path.rglob`

The iteration of the blocking generators produced by pathlib was performed in
the trio thread. With this fix, the previous behavior is restored: the blocking
generators are converted into lists in a thread dedicated to blocking IO calls.
