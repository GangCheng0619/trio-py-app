We cleaned up the distinction between the "abstract channel interface"
and the "memory channel" concrete implementation.
`trio.abc.SendChannel` and `trio.abc.ReceiveChannel` have been slimmed
down, `trio.MemorySendChannel` and `trio.MemoryReceiveChannel` are now
public types that can be used in type hints, and there's a new
`trio.abc.Channel` interface for future bidirectional channels.
