New and improved APIs for inter-task communication:
:func:`trio.open_channel` (replacing ``trio.Queue``). This interface
uses separate "send" and "receive" objects, for consistency with other
communication interfaces like :class:`trio.Stream`. Also, the two
objects can now be closed individually, making it much easier to
gracefully shut down a channel. Also, check out the nifty ``clone``
API to make it easy to manage fan-in scenarios. Also, the API has been
written to allow for future channel-like objects that send objects
across process boundaries. Also, it supports unbounded buffering if
you really need it. Also, help I can't stop writing also. See
:ref:`channels` for more details.
