:ref:`Subprocess support! <subprocess>` Add :mod:`trio.subprocess`, an
async wrapper around the stdlib :mod:`subprocess` module with a
similar interface: :class:`~trio.subprocess.Process` (renamed from
:class:`~subprocess.Popen`) to create a process and interact with it
at your leisure, :func`~trio.subprocess.run` to run a process to
completion and report the results, and reexports of all the stdlib
:mod:`subprocess` exceptions and constants. Instead of file objects,
the ``stdin``, ``stdout``, and ``stderr`` attributes of a
:class:`trio.subprocess.Process` are Trio streams.
