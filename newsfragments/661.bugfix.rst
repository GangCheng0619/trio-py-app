Fixed several bugs in the new Unix subprocess pipe support, where
(a) operations on a closed pipe could accidentally affect another
unrelated pipe due to internal file-descriptor reuse, (b) in very rare
circumstances, two tasks calling ``send_all`` on the same pipe at the
same time could end up with intermingled data instead of a
:exc:`BusyResourceError`.
