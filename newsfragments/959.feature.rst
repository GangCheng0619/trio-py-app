If you have a `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream` object, you can now use
``async for data in stream: ...`` instead of calling
`~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some`. Each iteration gives an
arbitrary sized chunk of bytes. And the best part is, the loop
automatically exits when you reach EOF, so you don't have to check for
it yourself anymore. Relatedly, you no longer need to pick a magic
buffer size value before calling
`~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some`; you can ``await
stream.receive_some()`` with no arguments, and the stream will
automatically pick a reasonable size for you.
