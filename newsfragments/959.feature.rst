If you have a `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream` object, you can now use
``async for data in stream: ...`` instead of calling
`~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some` repeatedly. And the best part
is, it automatically checks for EOF for you, so you don't have to.
Also, you no longer have to choose a magic buffer size value before
calling `~trio.abc.ReceiveStream.receive_some`; you can now call
``await stream.receive_some()`` and the stream will automatically pick
a reasonable value for you.
