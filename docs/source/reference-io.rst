I/O in Trio

The abstract Stream API
-----------------------

.. currentmodule:: trio.abc

Trio provides a set of abstract base classes that define a standard
interface for unidirectional and bidirectional byte streams.

Why is this useful? It lets you write generic protocol implementations
that can work over arbitrary transports, and its lets us write generic
adapter classes. Here's some examples:

* :mod:`trio.ssl.SSLStream` is a "stream adapter" that can take any
  object that implements the :class:`Stream` interface, and lets you
  speak SSL over it. Trio socket objects implement the :class:`Stream`
  interface, so in trio the standard way to speak SSL over the network
  is to wrap an :class:`~trio.ssl.SSLStream` around a socket object.

* If you spawn a subprocess then you can get a :class:`SendStream`
  that lets you write to its stdin, and a :class:`ReceiveStream` that
  lets you read from its stdout. If for some reason you wanted to
  speak SSL to a subprocess, you could use a
  :class:`~trio.StapledStream` to combine its stdin/stdout into a
  single bidirectional :class:`Stream`, and then wrap that in an
  :class:`~trio.ssl.SSLStream`::

     ssl_context = trio.ssl.create_default_context()
     ssl_context.check_hostname = False
     s = SSLStream(StapledStream(process.stdin, process.stdout), ssl_context)

  [Note: subprocess support is not implemented yet, but that's the
  plan. Unless it is implemented, and I forgot to remove this note.]

* It sometimes happens that you want to connect to an HTTPS server,
  but you have to go through a web proxy... and the proxy also uses
  HTTPS. So you end up having to do `SSL-on-top-of-SSL
  <https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2016/11/26/https-proxy-with-curl/>`__. In
  trio this is trivial â€“ just wrap your first
  :class:`~trio.ssl.SSLStream` in a second
  :class:`~trio.ssl.SSLStream`::

     s0 = await open_tcp_stream("proxy", 443)

     # Set up SSL connection to proxy:
     s1 = SSLStream(s0, proxy_ssl_context, server_hostname="proxy")
     # Request a connection to the website
     await s1.send_all(b"CONNECT website:443 / HTTP/1.0\r\n")
     await check_CONNECT_response(s1)

     # Set up SSL connection to the real website. Notice that s1 is
     # already an SSLStream object, and here we're wrapping a second
     # SSLStream object around it.
     s2 = SSLStream(s1, website_ssl_context, server_hostname="website")
     # Make our request
     await s2.send_all("GET /index.html HTTP/1.0\r\n")
     ...

* The :mod:`trio.testing` module provides a set of :ref:`flexible
  in-memory stream object implementations <testing-streams>`, so if
  you have a protocol implementation to test then you can can spawn
  two tasks, set up a virtual "socket" connecting them, and then do
  things like inject random-but-repeatable delays into the connection.

Trio currently provides one generic utility class for working with
streams. And if you want to test code that's written against the
streams interface, you should also check out :ref:`testing-streams` in
:mod:`trio.testing`.

Low-level sockets and networking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. module:: trio.socket

The :mod:`trio.socket` module provides trio's basic networking API.


:mod:`trio.socket`\'s top-level exports
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Generally, :mod:`trio.socket`\'s API mirrors that of the standard
library :mod:`socket` module. Most constants (like ``SOL_SOCKET``) and
simple utilities (like :func:`~socket.inet_aton`) are simply
re-exported unchanged. But there are also some differences:

All functions that return sockets (e.g. :func:`socket.socket`,
:func:`socket.socketpair`, ...) are modified to return trio sockets
instead. In addition, there is a new function to directly convert a
standard library socket into a trio socket:

.. autofunction:: from_stdlib_socket

The following functions have identical interfaces to their standard
library version, but are now ``async`` functions, so you need to use
``await`` to call them:

* :func:`~socket.getaddrinfo`
* :func:`~socket.getnameinfo`
* :func:`~socket.getfqdn`

Trio intentionally DOES NOT include some obsolete, redundant, or
broken features:

* :func:`~socket.gethostbyname`, :func:`~socket.gethostbyname_ex`,
  :func:`~socket.gethostbyaddr`: obsolete; use
  :func:`~socket.getaddrinfo` and :func:`~socket.getnameinfo` instead.

* :func:`~socket.getdefaulttimeout`,
  :func:`~socket.setdefaulttimeout`: Use trio's standard support for
  :ref:`cancellation`.

* On Windows, ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is not exported, because it's a trap:
  the name is the same as Unix ``SO_REUSEADDR``, but the semantics are
  `different and extremely broken
  <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740621(v=vs.85).aspx>`__. In
  the very rare cases where you actually want ``SO_REUSEADDR`` on
  Windows, then it can still be accessed from the standard library's
  :mod:`socket` module.


Socket objects
++++++++++++++

.. class:: SocketType()

   Trio socket objects are overall very similar to the :ref:`standard
   library socket objects <python:socket-objects>`, with a few
   important differences:

   **Async all the things:** Most obviously, everything is made
   "trio-style": blocking methods become async methods, and the
   following attributes are *not* supported:

   * :meth:`~socket.socket.setblocking`: trio sockets always act like
     blocking sockets; if you need to read/write from multiple sockets
     at once, then create multiple tasks.
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.settimeout`: see :ref:`cancellation` instead.
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.makefile`: Python's file-like API is
     synchronous, so it can't be implemented on top of an async
     socket.

   **No implicit name resolution:** In the standard library
   :mod:`socket` API, there are number of methods that take network
   addresses as arguments. When given a numeric address this is fine::

      # OK
      sock.bind(("127.0.0.1", 80))
      sock.connect(("2607:f8b0:4000:80f::200e", 80))

   But in the standard library, these methods also accept hostnames,
   and in this case implicitly trigger a DNS lookup to find the IP
   address::

      # Might block!
      sock.bind(("localhost", 80))
      sock.connect(("google.com", 80))

   This is problematic because DNS lookups are a blocking operation.

   For simplicity, trio forbids such usages: hostnames must be
   "pre-resolved" to numeric addresses before they are passed to
   socket methods like :meth:`bind` or :meth:`connect`. In most cases
   this can be easily accomplished by calling either
   :meth:`resolve_local_address` or :meth:`resolve_remote_address`.

   .. automethod:: resolve_local_address

   .. automethod:: resolve_remote_address

   **Modern defaults:** And finally, we took the opportunity to update
   the defaults for several socket options that were stuck in the
   1980s. You can always use :meth:`~socket.socket.setsockopt` to
   change these back, but for trio sockets:

   1. Everywhere except Windows, ``SO_REUSEADDR`` is enabled by
      default. This is almost always what you want, but if you're in
      one of the `rare cases
      <https://idea.popcount.org/2014-04-03-bind-before-connect/>`__
      where this is undesireable then you can always disable
      ``SO_REUSEADDR`` manually::

         sock.setsockopt(trio.socket.SOL_SOCKET, trio.socket.SO_REUSEADDR, False)

      On Windows, ``SO_EXCLUSIVEADDR`` is enabled by
      default. Unfortunately, this means that if you stop and restart
      a server you may have trouble reacquiring listen ports (i.e., it
      acts like Unix without ``SO_REUSEADDR``).  To get the Unix-style
      ``SO_REUSEADDR`` semantics on Windows, you can disable
      ``SO_EXCLUSIVEADDR``::

         sock.setsockopt(trio.socket.SOL_SOCKET, trio.socket.SO_EXCLUSIVEADDR, False)

      but be warned that `this may leave your application vulnerable
      to port hijacking attacks
      <https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740621(v=vs.85).aspx>`__.

   2. ``TCP_NODELAY`` is enabled by default.

   3. ``IPV6_V6ONLY`` is disabled, i.e., by default on dual-stack
      hosts a ``AF_INET6`` socket is able to communicate with both
      IPv4 and IPv6 peers, where the IPv4 peers appear to be in the
      `"IPv4-mapped" portion of IPv6 address space
      <http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPv6IPv4AddressEmbedding-2.htm>`__. To
      make an IPv6-only socket, use something like::

        sock = trio.socket.socket(trio.socket.AF_INET6)
        sock.setsockopt(trio.socket.IPPROTO_IPV6, trio.socket.IPV6_V6ONLY, True)

      This makes trio applications behave more consistently across
      different environments.

   4. On platforms where it's supported (recent Linux and recent
      MacOS), ``TCP_NOTSENT_LOWAT`` is enabled with a reasonable
      buffer size (currently 16 KiB).

   See `issue #72 <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/72>`__ for
   discussion of these defaults.

   The following methods are similar, but not identical, to the
   equivalents in :func:`socket.socket`:

   .. automethod:: bind

   .. automethod:: connect

   .. automethod:: send_all

   .. method:: sendfile

      `Not implemented yet! <https://github.com/python-trio/trio/issues/45>`__

   The following methods are identical to their equivalents in
   :func:`socket.socket`, except async, and the ones that take address
   arguments require pre-resolved addresses:

   * :meth:`~socket.socket.accept`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recv`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recv_into`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recvfrom`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recvfrom_into`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recvmsg` (if available)
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.recvmsg_into` (if available)
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.send`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.sendto`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.sendmsg` (if available)

   All methods and attributes *not* mentioned above are identical to
   their equivalents in :func:`socket.socket`:

   * :attr:`~socket.socket.family`
   * :attr:`~socket.socket.type`
   * :attr:`~socket.socket.proto`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.fileno`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.listen`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.getpeername`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.getsockname`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.close`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.shutdown`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.setsockopt`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.getsockopt`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.dup`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.detach`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.share`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.set_inheritable`
   * :meth:`~socket.socket.get_inheritable`
